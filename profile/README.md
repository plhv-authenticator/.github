## plhv-auth
_**Password Less Hash Verify Authenticator**_


Yes, we are building a **password less authentication interface** for both Mobile and Web applications. We have been doing this project since **September 2020**🥳.

# How it works:
Once the user create account with plhv-auth. A **unique 6-digit** code will be generated, this will help the user to login to the application. The 6-digit Code will be change in every 1 minute, So the unauthorized people can't access to your application till they find the correct code. Every time the user need to enter the correct Code for login to application.
